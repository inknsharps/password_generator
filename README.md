# Random Password Generator

This is a password generator that can generate a password using a selection of lowercase/uppercase letters, numbers and special characters. Any additional characters that you wish to add to those groups can be added without breaking functionality.

## Features

* Generate a random password in length from 8-128 characters.
* Choose to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers and/or special characters to your generated password.
* Easily add more characters to the generation pool by editing the character arrays in `script.js`.

## Usage

* Open up index.html.
* Click the Generate Password button.
* You will then be prompted to enter a number of characters to generate.
* Then you will be prompted to select the types of characters you wish to include in the generation.
* Finally, a randomly generated password will be shown on the page.
